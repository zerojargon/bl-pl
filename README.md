### A Simple Project to show how our components render in isolation, with their different variations, using different brand styles

## Installation

### NVM
It is highly recommended to use `nvm` to handle your node versions for different projects.

Obtain [nvm here](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#install-script).

Once installed, you can run the command `nvm install` from this projects directory to install the correct version of node.

### Dependencies
Install dependencies
```
npm i
```

## Running
To run the project locally
```
npm run dev
```

This will run on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) by default.

To specify a different port, use
```
npm run dev -- -p <your port here>
```
